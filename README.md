# jsfiddle-chrome-extension
Features:
1. JSFiddle runs automatically when key strikes stopped for 1.5 seconds. 
2. JSFiddle saves automatically with every 25 key strikes.
3. Adds a button on JSFiddle page to hide all panels other than js panel.

Feature 1 & 2 could be turned on/off by toggling the extension icon.
Feature 3 could be toggled with the "Hide/Show Extra Panels" button on JSFiddle Page.

Work in progress:
1. Add a configuration page for customize auto run delay and auto save key counts.

Special thanks to @mechanicious on github. I learnt how to enable auto run on JSFiddle from him, and then built this extension.
